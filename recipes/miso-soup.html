  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup that starts with a dashi stock and is flavored with miso paste. Dashi is an umami-rich stock made from dried seaweed and dried fish. Miso paste, meanwhile, is a paste made from soybeans, salt, and koji rice. The brothy soup usually contains tofu and green onions. It can also feature seaweed, mushrooms, daikon, and more.
    Miso soup is traditionally served with rice.
